description: Welcome to Intuit Ecosystem API

Intuit Ecosystem API is our newest platform. It utilizes the [GraphQL framework](https://graphql.org/) and makes developing focused solutions around specific accounting problems easier than ever.

Intuit Ecosystem API offers several advantages over our existing [REST-based QuickBooks Online Accounting API](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/learn/rest-api-features). In general, this new paradigm is more dynamic, requires fewer queries, and allows granular data scoping.
